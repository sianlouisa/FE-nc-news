** Netlify refresh issue - ask Paul?
** When logging out/clearing localStorage and refreshing, problems with trying to setState in unmounted components

## GENERAL

Not finished functionality & styling - including dead buttons
Cant vote / delete comments
No logout
Error handling including netflify issue
Good reusability from components and functions - go even more!
Keep destructing consistent

## README

**Needs writing!**

**Only have standard React README. Needs a description of your page, instructions on how to run, link to your heroku API and your back end repo etc**

- [ ] provides general info about app
- [ ] clear instructions on how to run locally
- [ ] link to API & back end repo
- [ ] specifies minimum versions
- [x] `package.json` includes dependencies
- [x] deployed

## ux

** Styling is not finished - Some basic layout is done, but the backgrounds, borders, colours etc need fixing
**Like the scroll on the list of articles and the ‘whats hot’ list
** The view/sort bar at the top of articles needs some work on the layout - it looks a bit quite confusing.
** `View 5 10 15` - what does this do?
** Viewing article list, use list style: none to remove bullet points
** Add comment box - width/height ratio: comments would usually be 1 or 2 lines so think about how the sizing could reflect what you expect the user to enter?
\*\* Time stamp formatting - not very user friendly, format it before rendering on the page

- [ ] Basic styling added \*\* The login page, this is the first page hiring partners will see, so needs some more styling, as a minimum some alignment? Otherwise, basic layout is nearly there - just needs some styling and refining - // LOGIN BUTTON
- [ ] Responsive design \*\* Not responsive, ‘whats hot’ sidebar takes up half the screen width, cannot read the articles clearly. Sort bar overhangs the article list.
- [ ] Items aligned \*\*log in page, sort bar, adding article form, add comment box,
- [x] Content legible (not too wide, obstructed, etc) \*\* Just need to fix colours/text contrasts - e.g. where you have black text on dark blue background
- [ ] Refreshing doesn’t cause an issue on sub-pages \*\* When refreshing, page not found error from netlify
- [x] No errors in the console \*\*Some error messages coming through from back end, and some error messages after clearing local storage and then refreshing - trying to setState on unmounted components
- [x] Login / Votes / Posts / Deletions happen instantly _OR_ give user indication of loading
      ** Login is instant, voting on articles is instant, posting comment is instant
      Ones that work are instant :)
      ** cannot vote on comments, cannot delete/no indication of this working

## Functionality

** Sort functionality - isn’t sorting them based on what is selected - sort functionality needs finishing or taking out. Comment count, title etc - although love the extensive sort functionality
** Least/Most is confusing when talking about sorting by title?
\*\* On individual article, ‘delete’ button - isn’t clear if it is for deleting comment or article. Cannot see a button to delete comments?

- [x] Some way to log in (should be very obvious to hiring partners)
- [x] A way to log out \*\* Have to clear localStorage in order to be logged out
- [x] Serves all articles / top articles
- [x] Can vote on articles
- [x] Can vote a maximum of once in either direction per page load
- [x] Votes are persistent when page is refreshed
- [x] Topic pages load only relevant articles (especially when navigating from one topic page to another)
- [x] Individual articles are served with comments
      \*\* No votes on comments, no functionality to cast votes on comments either
- [x] New comments are persistent
      CommentList:
      \*\* newComment: [], isNewComment, conditional render,
      [newComment, ...comments] spread in comments to avoid repeating yourself
- [ ] Can vote on comments
- [ ] Can only delete comments if logged in user
- [ ] Deleted comments don’t re-appear on re-render/refresh
- [ ] Can post an article \*\* Didn’t seem to work and no feedback for the user - might have posted the article but as sort wasn’t working and couldn’t change number of items in page, couldnt find the article I posted
- [ ] User page \*\* Can find the page for current user logged in, but no access to others. Maybe split your routes, /users and /users/username, rather than having the same page for both?
- [ ] Users page \*\* There is a page to view list of all users, but no navigation to it - have to change the url manually. Links on users page change the url but nothing happens
      UsersList is conditionally rendered based on whether users is an array, coming down from props. When you click a link to an individual user, props being passed down do not change, therefore the conditional render does not change

\*\* Delete article functionality doesn’t appear to be working?

## Error Handling

** When trying to get users/user_doesnt_exist , does not give an error
** Some pictures not displaying, no error handling for these
\*\* No catch blocks

- [ ] Error pages \*\* No error page/component
- [ ] All errors handled
  - Navigation: (Bad url / Bad topic slug in url / Bad article id in url / Bad username in url)
    ** No error message for bad url e.g. /article - receiving error code from back end but not being handled in front end
    ** No error message for bad topic slug
    \*\* No user-facing error message for an article id that does not exist 404, no error handling for invalid article id, 400 bad request
  - Login: (Bad username / No username)
    \*\* No error message when you log in without entering a username - allows you to log in
  - Post comment: (No text in comment body / Can you post without logging in?)
    \*\* Can post an empty comment
  - Post article: (No text in article body / No title / No topic selected / Can you post without logging in?)
    \*\* No error/form validation when trying to submit an article with no topic/content/title - error message in the console 422, but no error message to the user.

## Code

- [x] Well named components
      ** Most components well named
      ** Content - not well named, quite vague, what content is contained in here? Also unnecessary since it only contains one component
      ** Login component doesn’t actually have any log in functionality - display message / displayLoggedIn or similar?
      ** handle… functions well named
- [x] Functional components used where possible
- [x] `node_modules` git ignored
- [x] Components reused where possible (`Articles` / `Voter`...)
      ** ArticlesList component uses a map to produce individual articles - could these be extracted into article card component?
      ** Same for comments - can make one comment component to return within your map function - make it more DRY
      \*\* Good to see that Vote is a separate component although could have been used on comments too maybe?
- [x] Functions are DRY (`handleChange` for controlled components / api calls)
      \*\* Good that sortOptions is a separate component, but some of the functions used are not as DRY as they could be e.g. backPage/nextPage - you are passing in values when called, these could be one function
      You have done this when handling votes, well done!
- [?] Uses object destructuring where possible
- [x] No `console.log`s / comments
- [ ] If untidy recommend ESLint & Prettier

## STUDENTS SHOULD MAKE SURE ALL TESTS ARE STILL PASSING IN BACK END

## Stuff to ask for if it's already excellent (should make new branches for these changes & merge when ready)

- [ ] Add integration tests with `cypress`
- [ ] Make sure any code that can be extracted from components is extracted and tested with `Jest`
- [x] Add logged in user to session / local storage \*\* Need a way of logging out. Consider session storage instead?
- [ ] Use `aXe` extension to check for a11y issues
- [ ] Use Context API for sharing logged in user amongst components
- [ ] Add sorting functionality (make sure sort is not in render though)
      \*\* If cannot get sort working, best to take it out
- [ ] Add search functionality
