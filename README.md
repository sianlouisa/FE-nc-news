# NC News - Front End

A reddit-style news aggregator board built during training at Northcoders. Users are able to login to view articles, comments, their user profile and other users. Articles can be displayed by specific categories and sorted by vote-count, created at time or comment count. Users can vote on articles and their comments and delete their own posts. New topics and articles can also be added.
